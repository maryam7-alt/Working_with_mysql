#This is a code of Meryem Jemaa. 


#we will start with creating tables in mysql and then load our csv files. 

#data cleaning with Excel.

The dataset was messy and I had to do some transformation to make it align the properties of the table already created in Mysql.



--------------------------
#We create first table

Create table job_data (
Job_ID Int,
text varchar(500),
PRIMARY KEY (Job_ID)
); 


#We create the second Table
